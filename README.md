Zomato Dataset: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
This project involves performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Zomato dataset to uncover insights about restaurant ratings, locations, and cuisine trends. As a beginner project, it helped me understand how to explore and prepare data for further analysis or predictive modeling.

Project Overview
The Zomato dataset provides valuable information on restaurants, including their locations, cuisines, and customer ratings. The primary objectives of this project are:

Explore the dataset to identify key patterns and trends.
Visualize important features like restaurant ratings, popular cuisines, and city-wise distributions.
Extract meaningful insights that can guide decision-making for restaurant businesses.
Key Steps in the Project
1. Data Preprocessing
Cleaned the dataset by removing irrelevant, duplicate, or missing values.
Filtered the necessary columns: Restaurant Name, City, Cuisines, and Rating.
Standardized data formats for easier analysis.
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Visualized the distribution of restaurants across cities and their ratings using bar charts, pie charts, and histograms.
Analyzed the most popular cuisines across different cities.
Examined which cities have the highest concentration of top-rated restaurants.
3. Feature Extraction
Identified cuisines and restaurant attributes that contribute to higher ratings.
Created visual representations to highlight meaningful trends and patterns in the data.
Insights Uncovered
Discovered city-specific cuisine preferences and trends.
Found correlations between restaurant ratings and cuisines offered.
Identified cities with a higher number of top-rated restaurants.
Next Steps
This analysis forms the basis for further investigation, including building predictive models or providing data-driven recommendations to improve restaurant performance.

Libraries Used
pandas – for data manipulation and preprocessing.
numpy – for numerical operations.
matplotlib – for data visualization.
seaborn – for creating informative and attractive statistical plots.
